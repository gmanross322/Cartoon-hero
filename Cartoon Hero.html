        <h2>Thor in his 1st movie</h2>
        <p>Thor was first released in 2011. That movie was underwhelming to say the least. He loses his godly powers from his father. He gets sent to Earth and fights a tincan giant robot.</p>

        <!-- Avengers -->
        <h2>Thor in the Avengers</h2>
        <p>In the Avengers, he's the best and stronger character in the movie. I hate his annoying brother and helps to defeat his evil brother.</p>

        <!-- Age Of Ultron -->
        <h2>Thor in Age Of Ultron</h2>
        <p>Everyone knows the reason why I skipped the second Thor movie. Thor in Ultron is conflicted with hisself. He was corrupted by Scarlet Witch's powers and becomes one of the only people who let Vision to be created.</p>

        <!-- Ragnarok -->
        <h2>Thor Ragnarok: The Best Thor Movie</h2>
        <p>Thor shows a lot of growth in this movie. Here are some the reasons below:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>He loses his father</li>
            <li>Gets beaten up by his sister</li>
            <li>Loses his eye</li>
            <li>And thinks of a new way to defeat the villian</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These are the reasons it's the best movie. Also, he beats up Hulk.</p>

        <!-- Infinity War -->
        <h2>Thor in Avengers Infinity War</h2>
        <p>He loses the last people that is part of family. He loses Loki, that black guy and Asgard it self. Then his arrogance got the best of him; he didn't kill Thanos. Thor watched him kill half of the universe.</p>

        </ul>
        <!-- Avengers Endgame -->
        <h2>Thor in Avgeners Endgame</h2>
        <p>Thor is a joke in this movie. He is fat Thor now with an ugly beer belly. He's not trusted to use the Infinity Gauntlet. He gets beaten by Thanos easily. I hate this version of Thor. Mickey Mouse is taking the character backwards!</p>
